# EasyPlotter
Application for simple graph plotting
EasyPlotter is a graph plotting application written in C++ that allows users to easily plot mathematical functions and data sets. It uses ImGui for the user interface, Gnuplot for graph plotting, and exprtk for parsing mathematical expressions.

## Features
- Plot 2D functions.
- Customize graphs with titles, labels, and more.
- Export graphs to image files.

## Technologies and Libraries Used
- **ImGui**: A popular, fast, and easy-to-use graphical user interface library for C++.
- **Gnuplot**: A powerful plotting tool used to render graphs and visualizations.
- **exprtk**: A fast and lightweight mathematical expression parser and evaluator for C++.
- **DirectX 9 (DX9)**: Used for rendering graphics using the ImGui interface in this application.
- **Windows API (Win32)**: For handling windows and user interface events on Windows.
- **D3D9**: For handling graphics rendering in the context of ImGui.
